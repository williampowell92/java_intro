# Statically typed languages

A language is statically typed if the type of variable is known at compile time. This often means the programmer will have to specify the type of variable each time. Some statically typed languages have a type interface, allowing the system to detect a variable type.

An advantage of this is that the compiler does a lot of the checking, so bugs are often caught at an early stage.

# Dynamically typed languages

A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means the programmer does not have to specify types every time so can code a little quicker.
